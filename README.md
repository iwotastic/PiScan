# PiScan
PiScan is a work-in-progress utility for scanning BLE signals for BWSI PiPACT.

## Requirements
Presently, the following are required to build and run PiScan (I am working on lowering the requirement to non-prerelease software).
- An Apple Developer account
- Xcode 12 Beta
- iOS 14 Beta
- An iPhone to which you can deploy an app to

## Installation
0. Have all the requirements listed above (It is unlikely you could continue without them)
1. Clone this repo to your Mac
2. Change the team to your developer account
3. Change the bundle identifier for the PiScan target from `com.ianmorrill.PiScan` to `com.<Your Name Here>.PiScan`
4. Connect your iPhone
5. Hit the play button in the toolbar and cross your fingers!
